## Working on a Structure that holds an characterStat Dictionary and possibly could determine class depending on the comparison of each keys in the character stat

struct Person {
    var name: String
    var characterStat: [String : Int] = ["Strength":10, "Intelligence":10, "Vitality":10, "Dexterity":10, "Luck":10]
    func sayHello() {
        print("Hello, there! My name is \(name)!")
    }
    func declareStrength() {
        print(characterStat)
    }
}

let person = Person(name: "Francis", characterStat: [:])
person.sayHello()
person.declareStrength()
